  <p>
    I am a Master's student at the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/index.html" target="_blank">University of Alberta</a> 
    under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~jjin5/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Jun Jin</a>.  
    My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics and machine learning, particularly I am interested 
    in developing embodied continual learners. My current focus is on finding better ways 
    for machines/robots to represent their interactions with the environment, enhancing their learning process.
